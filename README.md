# SpringBoot-GameProject
Guess the number game using Spring Boot with a fully funcional page (localhost) where we can play the whole game. 

This project was made using Spring 2.4.1 and in Java 11 (Amazon Correto). Thymeleaf 3.0.12 introduces a bug where errors would be thrown and a downgrade was needed in both Spring Version and Java version. 

The problems have been documented at -> https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-spring/issues/255#issuecomment-969357864
